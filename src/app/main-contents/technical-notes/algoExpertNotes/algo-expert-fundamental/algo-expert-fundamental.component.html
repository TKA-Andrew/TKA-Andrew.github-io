                <p>These are my personal notes when I go through the <a href="https://www.algoexpert.io/product" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AlgoExpert course</a>.</p>
                <p>These are just short notes, the course is recommended as there are some great explanations for different algorithm questions.</p>
                <p>However, for alternative option, you may proceed with <a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LeetCode</a>.</p>

                <h2>Complexity Analysis</h2>
                <p>Commonly there are more than one solution to a problem. And how do we determine which one is better?
                    Through complexity analysis. The worse solutions normally have needless complexity. There are 2 types of complexity, time complexity and space complexity. You can refer to them together as space-time complexity as well.</p>
                <p>Time complexity is a measure of how fast an algorithm or solution runs.</p>
                <p>Space complexity is a measure of how much memory or space an algorithm uses up.</p>

            <div id="memory">
                <h2>Memory</h2>
                <p>There are few things that you need to know:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are limited memory in each computer</li>
                    <li>The data are stored in bytes ( 8 bits = 1 byte)</li>
                    <li>Int is 32-bit integer and Long is 64-bit integer, and these are called fixed-width integers</li>
                    <li>Hence, the memory taken up by the integers are fixed, depending on their data type, not their value</li>
                    <li>The idea of pointer is you record the memory address of another memory slot in a memory slot</li>
                </ul>

            </div>
            <div id="bigONotation">
                <h2>Big O Notation</h2>
                <p>Big O Notation is a notation used to describe the time complexity and space complexity of an algorithm.
                    For time complexity, it is not logical to exactly describe the speed of an algorithm with the unit of milliseconds or seconds,
                    as the execution time is affected by many factors such as programs running in the background or even processing ability of your CPU.</p>
                <p>Hence, to describe time complexity, we usually describe how fast an algorithm runs as the input size increases.
                    This is because different algorithms have different processing speeds when the input size is different.
                    Hence, we describe them with a notation, without any SI unit.</p>
                <p>The following are some common examples of complexities and their Big O Notations (ordered from fastest to slowest):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Constant: O(1)</li>
                    <li>Logarithmic: O(log(n))</li>
                    <li>Linear: O(n)</li>
                    <li>Log-Linear: O(nlog(n))</li>
                    <li>Quadaratic: O(n^2)</li>
                    <li>Cubic: O(n^3)</li>
                    <li>Exponential: O(2^n)</li>
                    <li>Factorial: O(n!)</li>

                <h2>Arrays</h2>
                <p>There are two types of arrays: Static Array & Dynamic Array. </p>
                <p>In C++ or Java, when you declare an array, you need to specify the length of the array.
                    On the other hand, in Python or Javascript, you do not need to specify the length of an array.</p>
                <p>The follwing are some array's standard operations and their corresponding time complexities:</p>
