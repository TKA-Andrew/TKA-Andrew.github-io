            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This page documents some notes I jotted when I played with TurtleBot2 during my university years.</p>
            <p>These notes were also used to tramsfer knowledge to my juniors.</p>
            <p>The development environment was Ubuntu 14.04 with ROS Indigo.</p>

            <h2>Simultaneous Localization & Mapping (SLAM) using gmapping</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Run the following commands in your terminal:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="CLI-font">roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch</span></li>
                        <li><span class="CLI-font">roslaunch turtlebot_navigation gmapping_demo.launch</span></li>

                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <b>OR</b>
                    Simply create a .launch file with the following content and then roslaunch it:
                    <pre>
                        <code>
    &lt;launch>
        &lt;include file="$(find turtlebot_bringup)/launch/minimal.launch" />
        &lt;include file="$(find turtlebot_navigation)/launch/gmapping_demo.launch" />
        &lt;include file="$(find turtlebot_rviz_launchers)/launch/view_navigation.launch"/>
    &lt;/launch>
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                <li>You should see that RVIZ is opened, you can now navigate your turtlebot around the
                    unknown map using the keyboard teleoperation.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="CLI-font">roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="font-style: italic;">Side Note: If you have another computer and WiFi connection, 
                        you can control your robot remotely by running keyboard_teleop on the second computer. 
                        Refer to this <a href="http://learn.turtlebot.com/2015/02/01/7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutorial</a> regarding this.</p>
                <li>Navigate the turtlebot around and you should see the map is generated on RVIZ at the same time.</li>
                <li>Once you’re done building a map, save it with the following command:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="CLI-font">rosrun map_server map_saver -f /DIRECTORY/YOUR_FILE_NAME</span></li>
                        <li>For example: <span class="CLI-font">rosrun map_server map_saver -f /home/tka-andrew/my_map</span></li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>Getting position and orientation of robot/destination</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Run the following commands in your terminal:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="CLI-font">roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch</span></li>
                        <li><span class="CLI-font">roslaunch turtlebot_navigation amcl_demo.launch
                            map_ file:=/DIRECTORY/YOUR_FILE_NAME.yaml</span></li>
                        <li><span class="CLI-font">roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_navigation.launch</span></li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Your map will come up on the screen, you should calibrate the current position of
                    Turtlebot by selecting 2D pose estimate on the upper tab.</li>
                <li>Using keyboard_teleop, you can freely navigate your turtlebot around the map to any
                    position in the map. This will furher make the position and orientation more accurate.</li>
                <li>Navigate your turtlebot to your desired spot, and run the command below to obtain your
                    Turtlebot’s current pose information.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="CLI-font">rostopic echo /amcl_pose</span></li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Then you will see something like this:</li>

                    They can be used to define the coordinates (including the direction that you want the robot to face at) of some destinations for your robot to navigate to.
                </li>
                <li>For example,in your program, you can do something like this:</li>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
    self.locations=dict()

                        </code>
                    </pre>
                <li>Simply replace the values of Point() with position x, y, z and the values of Quaternion() coordinates with orientation x, y, z, w.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>From the previous section you already know how to get the orientation and position of robot. 
                    Now you </li>
                <li>Copy the amcl_demo.launch in opt/ros/indigo/share/turtlebot_navigation/launch</li>
                <li>If you look at the launch file, there are three lines that defined the initial pose:</li>

                    </pre>
                <li>To set the value of initial_pose_x and initial_pose_y, refer to the pose.position.x and pose.position.y.</li>
                <li>To set the value of initial_pose_a, refer to the section “How to get initial_pose_a from

                    </ul>
                <li>According to the first link, the initial pose_a is actually yaw(rotation about z-axis in unit
                    radian).</li>
                <li>Note that roll, pitch, yaw are the elements of Euler Angles whereas the “orientation” we
                    get from /amcl_pose rostopic is actually Quaternion.</li>
                <li>In the second reference link, the wikipedia declare component w of Quaternion as q0, x
                    as q1, y as q2 and z as q3</li>
                    <img style="width: 90%;" src="assets/images/Turtlebot2/turtlebot2_01.png">
                <li>In the section “Euler Angles to Quaternion Conversion”</li>

                <li>Therefore, according to number 4 and 5, the first element of the matrix is Qw, followed
                    by Qx, Qy and Qz.</li>
                <li>The following explains what the symbols in number 5 represent. Actually, the bank is
                    roll, attitude is pitch and heading is yaw</li>
                    <img style="width: 90%;" src="assets/images/Turtlebot2/turtlebot2_03.png">
                <li>For our case, our roll and pitch will be zero because our robot doesnt robot about x and y
                    axis. Therefore, we only concern on the yaw, which is our initial_pose_a value.
                    According to number 5, we can get the value of yaw if we know Qz or Qw. But after a
                    few trials, we noticed that Qz is more accurate compared to Qw, dont know why.</li>

                    not outside of the maximum size of a map.</li>
                <li>If you bring the robot out of the maximum map(the gray area), the robot will not be able
                    to do autonomous navigation.</li>
                <li>The robot will be able to perform autonomous navigation within the gray area, although the area is not scanned.</li>

            <h2>How to edit the size of map before building the map</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>This is for those building map with SLAM only. If you are using SLAM in this tutorial to
                    build map, the package that you use will be turtlebot_navigation and the launch file that you use
                    will be gmapping_demo.launch. And if you are using kincct to build map, the file that controls
                    all the settings of the map will be kinect_gmapping.launch.xml</li>
                <img style="width: 90%;" src="assets/images/Turtlebot2/turtlebot2_05.png">
                    
                <li>According to the directory above, find out the kinect_gmapping.launch.xml file and open
                    it with gedit. Then you will see that the default map size as below:</li>
                    <pre>
    &lt;param name="xmin" value="-1.0"/>
    &lt;param name="ymin" value="-1.0"/>
    &lt;param name="xmax" value="1.0"/>
    &lt;param name="ymax" value="1.0"/>
                    </pre>
                <li>You may try to increase the map size:</li>
                    <pre>
    &lt;param name="xmin" value="-50.0"/>
    &lt;param name="ymin" value="-50.0"/>
    &lt;param name="xmax" value="50.0"/>
    &lt;param name="ymax" value="50.0"/>
                    </pre>
                <li>&lt;param name="delta" value="0.04"/> the value for delta is better is less than 0.05,
                    recommended 0.04.</li>

            <h2>How to identify different kinects when more than one kinect is used</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>To use two kinects, you need to have two launch files for two respective kinect.</li>
                <li>For example, I write a HMC_basicNodes.launch that launch all basic things necessary. In
                    this basicNodes.launch, i included the following launch files that launch the 2 different
                    3dsensor.launch</li>
                    <img style="width: 80%;" src="assets/images/Turtlebot2/turtlebot2_06.png">
                <li>Note that I define the argument “camera” as “camera2” to let the system to differentiate
                    it. Regarding other settings, you need to discover by yourselves. You need to copy the
                    default 3dsensor.launch and modify it.</li>
                <li>For each 3dsensor.launch, you need to have a folder for it, and the folder i mean is the
                    following:</li>
                    <img style="width: 80%;" src="assets/images/Turtlebot2/turtlebot2_07.png">
                    <p>Therefore, for 3dsensor_move_base and 3dsensor_follower, you need to copy the folder
                        above and rename it as well.</p>
                    <img style="width: 80%;" src="assets/images/Turtlebot2/turtlebot2_08.png">
                <li>Inside the 3dsensor folder, there is a document called kinect.launch.xml, open it and edit
                    the device id:</li>
                    <img style="width: 80%;" src="assets/images/Turtlebot2/turtlebot2_09.png">
                <li>If you don't know the device id of the kinect, just simply connect the kinect to your
                    laptop and launch 3dsensor bringup</li>
