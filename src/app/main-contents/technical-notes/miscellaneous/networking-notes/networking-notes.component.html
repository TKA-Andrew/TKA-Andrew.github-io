    <h3>Miscellaneous Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Networks are made up of various devices—computers, switches, routers—connected together by cables or wireless signals.</li>
        <li>When our browser surfs "www.google.com", it is actually making a DNS query and the DNS will return the ip address of the server that serves us the Google.com.</li>
        <li>A server listens for requests on specific ports.</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h3>IP Address & Ports</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>IP address = an address given to each machine connected to the public Internet.</li>
        <li>IPv4 addresses consist of four numbers separated by dots and all the four numbers are between 0 and 255.</li>
        <li>localhost IP address = 127.0.0.1</li>
        <li>IP address of private network = 192.168.x.y (For example, every device that connected to the same private wifi network will have the same prefix)</li>
        <li>Any machine that has a distinct IP address has 2^16 ports in total (between 0 and 65535).</li>
        <li>A port can be referred to as a logical channel through which data can be sent/received to an application.</li>
        <li>Ports 0-1023 are reserved for system ports and should not be used by user-level processes.</li>
        <li>If a client is trying to speak to a server using HTTP protocol, it's always going to use port 80.</li>
        <li>Some ports with pre-defined uses:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>22: Secure Shell</li>
                <li>53: DNS lookup</li>
                <li>80: HTTP</li>
                <li>443: HTTPS</li>
            </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Public Network vs Private Network</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>An internal network, also known as a private network, is a network that is only accessible by devices within a private organization or home and is not accessible by the general public.</li>
        <li>An external network, also known as a public network, is a network that is accessible by devices outside of the private network, such as the internet.</li>
        <li>A private IP address is an IP address that is used within a private network and is not accessible from the internet.</li>
        <li>A public IP address is an IP address that is used on the internet and is accessible from anywhere in the world. </li>
        <li>To spot the difference between private and public IP addresses, you can check the IP address ranges. 
            Private IP addresses are typically assigned from the following ranges:
        </li>
            <ul>
                <li>10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255</li>
                <li>172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255</li>
                <li>192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255</li>
            </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Subnet mask</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The IP addresses within a network are determined by the subnet mask, which is a value that is used to divide the IP address into two parts: the network address and the host address. </li>
        <li>The subnet mask is used to define which portion of the IP address belongs to the network and which portion belongs to the host.</li>
        <li>The subnet mask is usually represented in the form of a dotted decimal notation, such as 255.255.255.0. </li>
        <li>The subnet mask 255.255.255.0 means that the first 24 bits (3 bytes) of the IP address are used for the network address and the last 8 bits (1 byte) are used for the host address.</li>
        <li>When you assign an IP address to a device, you also need to assign a subnet mask, the subnet mask and the IP address together will determine which network the device belongs to.</li>
        <li>Once the subnet mask determines which network the devices belong to, it can be used to determine whether the devices are "within the same network".</li>
        <li>Devices "within the network" typically refers to devices that are assigned IP addresses within the same subnet, as determined by the subnet mask.</li>
        <li>Devices within the same network can communicate with each other directly (such as through SSH), 
            without the need for routing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Internal Switch vs External Switch</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>An internal switch is a switch that is located inside a device such as a router, a computer, or a server. 
            It is used to provide connectivity within the device and to route or switch data between internal interfaces or ports.</li>
        <li>An external switch, on the other hand, is a standalone networking device that is located outside of a device. 
            It is typically used to provide connectivity for multiple devices on a LAN (Local Area Network) or a WAN (Wide Area Network) by connecting to the devices via Ethernet cables. 
        </li>
        <li>To clarify, internal switches are used to create network connections within a single device, while external switches are used to connect multiple devices to form a network.</li>
        <li>In the case of using Hyper-V, the 'Default Switch' is an internal switch, and the network between
            VM and the host PC is internal and not accessible outside of the device. Hence, if you want your VM to be accessible by 
            another PC connected to the same Local Area Network, you should use External Switch as Network Adapter for your VM.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>MAC Address (Media Access Control address)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Is considered as physical address, because a MAC address is assigned to the NIC at the time of manufacturing. </li>
        <li>As typically represented, MAC addresses are recognizable as six groups of two hexadecimal digits, separated by hyphens, colons, or without a separator.
            For example: 00:00:5e:00:53:af.
        </li>
        <li>Since MAC addresses are unique, they are used in internet and networking to identify and differentiate devices on a LAN (Local Area Network) or WAN (Wide Area Network) 
            and also at the data link layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Proxies</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Forward Proxy = a server that sits between a client and servers, and acts on behalf of the client, typically used to mask the client's IP address.</li>
        <li>Reverse Proxy = a server that sits between servers and clients, and acts on behalf of the servers, typically used for logging, load balancing, or caching.</li>
        <li>Nginx is a very popular webserver that is often used as a reverse proxy and load balancer.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Switches</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Switches allow devices on your network to communicate with each other, as well as with other networks, creating a network of shared resources.</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Routers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Routers connect multiple networks together. They also connect computers on those networks to the Internet.</li>
        <li>Routers enable all networked computers to share a single Internet connection.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Wireless Access Points</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>An access point allows devices to connect to the wireless network without cables.</li>
        <li>An access point acts like an amplifier for your network. While a router provides the bandwidth, 
            an access point extends that bandwidth so that the network can support many devices, and those devices can access the network from farther away.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sockets</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The unique combination of IP address and Port number together are termed as Socket.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>DHCP vs Static</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>IP addresses are either configured manually (static IP address) or configured by a DHCP server.</li>
        <li>Static IP</li>
        <ul>
            <li>A static IP address is an address that is permanently assigned to your network devices by your Internet Service Provider, 
                and does not change even if your device reboots.</li>
            <li>It's more expensive than a dynamic IP address because ISP often charges an additional fee for static IP addresses.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>DHCP</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Dynamic IP address is an address that keeps on changing.</li>
            <li>To create dynamic IP addresses, the network must have a DHCP server configured and operating.</li>
            <li>DHCP does not need any manual configuration to connect to local devices or gain access to the Web.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>HTTP vs Websocket</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Both HTTP and WebSocket are communication protocols used in client-server communication.</li>
        <li>HTTP/HTTPS</li>
            <ul>
                <li>HTTP is unidirectional where the client sends the request and the server sends the response.</li>
                <li>After each respond is sent, the connection gets closed. </li>
            </ul>
        <li>WebSocket</li>
            <ul>
                <li>WebSocket is bidirectional, a full-duplex protocol that is used in the same scenario of client-server communication, unlike HTTP it starts from ws:// or wss://.</li>
                <li>It is a stateful protocol, which means the connection between client and server will keep alive until it is terminated by either party (client or server). </li>
                <li>Some applications of websocket:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Real-time web application uses a web socket to show the data at the client end, which is continuously being sent by the backend server.</li>
                        <li>In gaming application, data is continuously received by the server without even establishing new connection.</li>
                        <li>In chat application, once the WebSocket connection is successful, the same WebSocket connection will be reused
                            for sending and receiving the messages.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
    </ul>
